This example demonstrates a common error in React's `useEffect` hook.  The code attempts to increment the `count` state variable within the `useEffect` function, leading to an infinite loop because the effect runs repeatedly without any condition to stop it.  The solution demonstrates how to avoid this by using functional updates to the state and providing a dependency array that appropriately controls re-renders.
